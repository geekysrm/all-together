# All Together

_Community helps community_

## Idea

We are planning to build an app which will show the users of the app essential services available near them and if the location is currently crowded or not in realtime. We will also show the distance to them through Maps.
Apart from this, the users can also check the availability of various items in their local shops, thus helping them to save their time and energy.
We think this app will be beneficial to all trying to maintain social distancing by providing them crucial information of various shops and services in their locality.
