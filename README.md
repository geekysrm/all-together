# All Together

_Community helps community_

## Idea

We are planning to build an app which will show users of the app local shops, medicine stores etc near them and no. of people inside them in realtime. We will also show the distance to them through Maps.
Apart from this, users can see in realtime the no. of essentials/ things to buy in the market/shop from the phone. The information will be crowd sourced in realtime. 
We are also planning to add realtime chat among the users in a particular shop.
We think this app will be beneficial to all in trying times like these.
